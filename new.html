      <h2>Main Quote</h2>
      <p>One of the central ideas in Srinivasan's work is his critique of the concept of a "global village" made possible by digital technologies. He argues that while technology often promises global interconnectedness, it frequently ignores the cultural and social complexities of local communities. A quote that captures this perspective is:
        <b>“We should recognize the importance of designing technologies with the cultures and communities they are supposed to serve. In so doing, they can support not only the local ontologies and voices of these peoples but empower performances and practices that bind and sustain community.”(Srinivasan, 2017)</b>
        </p>

    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="personalopinion">
      <h2>Personal Opinion</h2>
      <p>This idea resonates strongly with me. I’ve always been intrigued by how technology is framed as an equalizer promising to connect everyone, regardless of geographic or socio-economic background. However, Srinivasan challenges this assumption by showing that technology is often shaped by the values, priorities, and biases of the designers. If we look at the way digital tools are used around the world, it’s clear that access to technology doesn’t automatically translate to equitable outcomes. In fact, digital platforms can sometimes deepen existing inequalities, especially when they fail to account for local contexts.</p>
      <p>For example, social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. These platforms are presented as tools for global conversation, but they often reflect and amplify local power imbalances. The design of these platforms may not account for the cultural practices or communication styles of different communities. Srinivasan’s argument encourages us to reconsider this "global village" narrative, suggesting instead that technologies should be adapted to local realities and designed with communities' specific needs in mind. This is crucial to ensuring that technology empowers local voices, rather than silencing or distorting them.</p>

    <!-- Impact Section -->
    <section id="newspaperarticle">
      <h2>Newspaper Article</h2>
      <p>In a recent article from Times of India (April 2023), it aligns well with Srinivasan’s perspective on designing technologies that empower and serve local communities. It discusses how technology solutions tailored specifically to rural India are addressing local needs in areas like agriculture, e-commerce, and financial inclusion. These innovations reflect Srinivasan’s argument that technologies should be designed with local ontologies in mind, focusing on the unique challenges and values of the communities they serve, rather than imposing global, one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>
      <p>The article also highlights how technologies such as agriculture apps and digital marketplaces are improving the lives of rural populations by enhancing economic opportunities and community practices. These technologies are not only solving practical problems but also respecting and supporting local knowledge and traditions. By designing tech that responds to local realities, these innovations empower communities and preserve their cultural practices, aligning with Srinivasan’s idea of technology serving as a tool for community-based empowerment.</p>
      <p> Moreover, the article underscores that many of these technologies are created by local entrepreneurs and grassroots organizations, ensuring they are both culturally relevant and effective. This reflects Srinivasan’s belief that technology should be designed through collaboration with the community, respecting local needs and priorities. By focusing on solutions that are locally driven, these technologies promote community autonomy and cultural preservation, which is central to Srinivasan’s critique of global, top-down technological solutions.</p>

      <h2>Journal Article</h2>
      <p>To further support Srinivasan’s argument, I turn to a peer-reviewed article titled “Digital Colonialism: Neo-Colonialism of Global South” by Bhavna Dahiya (May 2023). ). In this article, B. Dahiya discusses how the dominance of Western tech companies contributes to what she calls “digital colonialism.” She argues that the design and governance of digital platforms are largely shaped by the priorities of corporations based in the Global North, with little regard for the cultures, knowledge systems, and practices of communities in the Global South.</p>
      <p>B. Dahiya’s work aligns closely with Srinivasan’s critique of the global village. She explains that the global reach of digital technology does not necessarily lead to a more equitable or inclusive world rather, it can perpetuate systems of power that marginalize local cultures. The article stresses that the imposition of Western-designed digital platforms without considering local contexts results in the "colonization" of digital spaces where local voices are overshadowed by the interests of powerful multinational corporations.</p>
      <p>B. Dahiya advocates for the “decolonization” of digital spaces, which resonates with Srinivasan’s call to provincialize digital media. By designing technology that takes local knowledge and community practices into account, we can help ensure that digital tools serve the needs of all people, not just the powerful few.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section id="Conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In Conclusion, Srinivasan’s critique of the “global village” and his call to provincialize digital media is both timely and relevant. Technology should not be viewed as a neutral tool that automatically connects people across borders; it must be designed with local contexts in mind. The examples from Times of India and the academic work of B. Dahiya both support this perspective, showing that when technology is designed without considering the needs and cultures of diverse communities, it can reinforce existing power structures and exacerbate inequality. By focusing on local ontologies and respecting the voices of communities, as Srinivasan suggests, we can ensure that digital technology becomes a true tool for empowerment. The path forward lies not in promoting a utopian global village but in designing technologies that recognize and respect cultural diversity, local knowledge, and community-based practices.</p>

      <h2>Medium is the Message</h2>
      <p>A website is one of the best ways to share a message today because it’s accessible to anyone, anytime, from anywhere. It’s not just a static page — it’s a place where people can interact with your content, whether it’s through videos, comments, or even real-time updates. Plus, websites give you the flexibility to adjust your message based on what your audience is interested in, using data to understand their needs better. In a world where everyone’s online, a website allows you to connect with people in a way that’s personal, engaging, and always available.</p>
